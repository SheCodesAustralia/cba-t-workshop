Let's write our first line of CSS!

Fork the [template on CodePen.](https://codepen.io/shecodesaus/pen/KKyrEvB)

You should see four boxes (divs) like the below:

![](../../images/boxes.png)

Navigate to the CSS editor in CodePen and look for the line that says `Your CSS here`.
We'll be adding all of our CSS below this line.

We'll start by changing the colour of page.

Add the following css:

```css
/* Your CSS here */

body {
  background-color: orange;
}
```

{{% notice test %}}

The page should turn orange!

{{% /notice %}}

Nice work!
Your first line of CSS!

{{% notice tip %}}

Feel free to take a peek at the CSS we wrote for you.
This CSS it what arranges the divs in a grid and gives them borders.
In a few steps time, you'll be able to create this too!

{{% /notice %}}
