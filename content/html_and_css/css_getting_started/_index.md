### Time to Add Some Frosting!

After HTML, CSS is the most common programming language on the internet, and can be the most exciting when you delve into the more advanced side of things.

Think of HTML as your cupcake base - it's essential and gives you structure, but it's pretty plain on its own. CSS is like the frosting, sprinkles, and decorative touches that transform that simple cupcake into something absolutely irresistible!

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 1rem 0;">
<img src="../images/cupcake.png" alt="Cupcake" style="width: 120px; height: auto;">
</div>

Typically CSS is used to change the look and feel of a website: colours, fonts, sizes, layout, how and where things appear on the page. But as CSS gets bigger and better, you can even use it to animate elements on your webpage - think of it as adding those special sparkly sprinkles that catch the light just right.
