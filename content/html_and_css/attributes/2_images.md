All of the elements we have used so far have had an opening and a closing tag.

There are a few elements that are **self closing**.
For these tags, instead of having content between an open and close tag, they have content provided as an **attribute**.

The image element is a self closing element, and has the tagname `img`.

We can use the following html to add an image to a webpage:

```html {title="html"}
<img src="link/to/image" />
```

The `src` attribute means **source** and it expects a URL to an image.

The next challenge asks you to add images to your page.
Here are three image URLs to use for this challenge:

- <a href="https://assets.codepen.io/5804361/turtle_1.jpg" target="_blank">Turtle 1</a>
- <a href="https://assets.codepen.io/5804361/turtle_2.jpg" target="_blank">Turtle 2</a>
- <a href="https://assets.codepen.io/5804361/turtle_3.jpg" target="_blank">Turtle 3</a>
