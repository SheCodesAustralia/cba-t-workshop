One of the most common HTML elements is the **paragraph** element, which has the tag name of `p`.

We use the paragraph element when we want to display a block of text.

For example:

```html {title="html"}
<h3>Size</h3>

<p>The size of a turtle varies depending on it's species, age, diet, gender, habitat and UV light.</p>
```

This should be the resulting page:

{{% notice style="info" title="Challenge!" icon="lightbulb" %}}

Add a paragraph to each sub section on your page.

{{% /notice %}}
