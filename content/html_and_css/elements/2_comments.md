Quite often we want to leave a note in our code to explain what something does (especially if we are new to this).
We can do this by writing **comments**.

Comments are tags that appear in our code but not on the webpage.
This lets us write notes to ourselves about what some code means and what it does.


A comment looks like this:

```html {title="html"}
<h1>Myrtle the Turtle</h1>
<!-- This is a comment to myself -->
<h2>Anatomy and Physiology</h2>
<h3>Size</h3>
```

The above html looks like this when rendered:

![The resulting webpage from the comment code snippet.](../../images/myrtle_headings.png)

{{% notice style="info" title="Challenge!" icon="lightbulb" %}}

Add comments to your code to explain what each line of code does.

{{% /notice %}}
