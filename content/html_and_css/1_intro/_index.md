For this course weâ€™ll be writing our code on Codepen, which is an online code editing tool. This allows us to write HTML and CSS without needing to install anything on your computer as we'll do it all in a web browser.

Before you start writing any code, [head over to CodePen](https://codepen.io) and sign up for a free account.
